.SH NAME
.B simple_shell
- Simple shell created in C to interact with a Linux operating system.
.SH SYNOPSIS
 hsh [option]s [file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Shell is a UNIX term for the interactive user interface of an operating system. The shell is the programming layer that understands the commands entered by a user and executes commands entered by a user. On some systems, the shell is also called a command interpreter. A shell usually means an interface with a command syntax
.B Overview
The simple shell is a command program that reads lines from a file or from the terminal, interprets them, and usually executes other commands. It is the program that starts when a user logs on to the system. It contains many functions that facilitate interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretation language is the same for both interactive and non-interactive (shell script) use. That is, commands can be typed directly into the running Simple Shell or into a file that can be executed directly by the Simple Shell.
.SH Return Value
Always return 0 for success, any other number means an error.
.SH PATH
Searches for executable files at all addresses in the PATH environment variable.
